Actors will have a series of attachment points for wearables and accessories. These attachments should have clearly definable behavior to allow for different scenarios and stories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Attachment Relationship: The attachment points are to be related to a part of the actor body's part, as determined by the body. However, convention in this matter is prudent and will be expounded on below.
    \item Layering Status: Each of the attachment points should expect that they may be covered by another, the rules of which are determined by the attached element.
    \item Blocking and Locking: Certain attachments will block others by their nature, such as with helmets and masks. As well, some attachments may need to be locked by means of a key or magical effect, such as a cursed gauntlet or a prisoners manacles. The logic of placing and releasing these attachments will need to be appropriately handled, but the exposing of functions related should be clear and concise.
    \item Outwards accessability: Other actors, including the player, will have the ability to read, place, and release an item under the same logic as the player would to themselves, if allowed.
