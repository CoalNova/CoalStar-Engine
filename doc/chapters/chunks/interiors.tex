Interior spaces are almost exclusively the realm of intradimensional projection. They utilize a series of portals for any doors, windows, or other holes that can be passed through. Though the portals will traditionally use entangled setpieces for unifying the experience, they can be open to disconnected and disjointed on either end to allow for custom events.

Portals are comprised of three components: a viewport to render the far side, a translational barrier to move players/actors/non-static setpieces to or from the far side, and a housed model to link to prevent rendering problems with meshes that pass that boundary.
