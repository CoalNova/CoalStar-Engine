Chunks are stored using a separate list for heights, setpieces, zones, intradimensional entries, actors, and generational overrides.

Height data is represented as a unsigned 16-bit integer, every two units(meters). It is multiplied by 0.1 for granularity, and added to a height offset. The offset is an unsigned 8-bit integer, multiplied by 1024.0. The storage for height data is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item start with last height at 0, starting height is expected above that
    \item if current height is less than 64 +- last height save current height as u8. (delta + 64)
    \item else if it is greater than, save the whole u16 with a 1 in the most significant position
    \item regardless set current height as last height and continue
\end{itemize}

Setpieces are saved as a list of OGDs, further expounded in the Setpieces section.

Zones will be mapped linearly, denoting what the zone type is and its length. Zone types are expounded in their section.

Intradimensional entries will be handled as clusters of Setpiece OGDs, with a prefix for each intradimensional layer.

Actors will be generated by being pulled from a separate actor list, which contains relevant actor data.

Overrides refer to the updates to the deterministic generation. Override tables for saves will follow the same format for ease of application.
