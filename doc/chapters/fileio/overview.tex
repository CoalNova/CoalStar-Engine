The File IO operations cover all elements of loading and unloading file data. The individual systems within handle resultant format processing required from and to a serialized state. Filename associations and archive offsets for any runtime accessed types are stored in a manifest associated to each "type" of resource data, by usage.

The file layout is a metablock header used for each file, which simply has the string "Coalstar" and a version number.
