A detail that needs addressing is that of Urban City design. Regardless of theme, dense population centers are not well designed for lightweight processing, in either CPU or GPU areas. For this, the cities will need to be broken apart, and reformed using linked nodes within larger areas. 

This will be a blending of Binary Space Partitioning and a tree design. The walls for the BSP will be the separation buildings. The location of the focus within this tree should dictate resolution of Actor activity, as well as rendering guidelines for rendered Level of Detail. Shading will use a series of live baked stencils around the edge dividers of the tree, instead of projection-based solutions.
