The worldspace is visually broken into two systems. The first is LODWorld, a low Level Of Detail representation of the worldspace which has a tbd generation method. A live/unlive version may be best, with a minimum viable product existing from the initial creation stage, and an updated, higher-detail version being generated concurrently at runtime. This would allow for both game settings based changes for performance, and any added/altered content to not need a revision of the entire LODWorld initial state.
