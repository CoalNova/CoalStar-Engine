The worldspace for use in the engine is designed around, and intended for, super-massive overworld spaces. The first usage of this system is for a 128 x 128 km island world. The world in it's entirety should be visible to establish scale. Contemporary techniques of obscuring sitelines through natural barriers and/or fog should be minimized or unused entirely.

With the worldspace so large, certain limitations will need to be put in place to guarantee player retention. Quests or missions should not extend outside of immediate area, without necessary reason. At no point should a quest feature a single go-and-return loop. If the player needs to return to the origin, do so only after reaching a tertiary location, as backtracking should ideally never occur. The caveat is that backtracking is ideal for viewing an environment in a new light, but that requires either a great reveal or change in scenery throughout that journey.

Locomotion through the world should not be an immediate point-to-point fast travel, but rather an earned reward for growth, ability unlock, and understanding of the world itself. Rapid locomotion is a goal, with internal systems designed around allowing immediate unloading of assets or loading queues. Point to point teleportation will still be allowed at an engine level, which will require a loading transition of some sort for a minimum of assets to be generated to comfort player experience.
