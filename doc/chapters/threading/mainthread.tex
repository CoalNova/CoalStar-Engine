The main thread is the governor for any systems within, and solely responsible for starting and stopping the engine. It handles inputs and events, delegating the intent of those to the other threads when and where needed.

Unlike other threads, the main thread does not have a worker queue, as it needn't process any jobs. Instead, all feedback comes exclusively fromm the enginestate flags.
