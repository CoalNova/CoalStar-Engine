The script thread will handle script processing, and execute scripts through a series of interfaces.

The types of these interfaces, in order of execution frequency:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Update(): will execute every frame, or as often as it can.
    \item OtherUpdate(): will execute every other frame, balanced between two pools.
    \item BalancedUpdate(): will execute across a pool which maintains a square layout, with each next column executing per frame.
    \item SequentialUpdate(): will execute as a member of a linear series, with one execution happening per frame. 
\end{itemize}
