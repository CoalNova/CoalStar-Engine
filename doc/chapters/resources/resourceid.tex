The resource ID is the handle used to identify a resource within the engine, unique to each game. If the resource is overwritten in the archives, then it is by the resource ID. Resource ID's are comprised of two parts: the UID, and the type enum. The type enum simply tells the engine what the resource is, the uid is linked to where the consequent data is stored.

These two are compressed within a packed struct, as an 8-bit enum and 24-bit integer UID. The 24-bits allows for over 4 million unique resources of each type, sufficient for any game. All addressing of the resource's ID is through a resource ID.
