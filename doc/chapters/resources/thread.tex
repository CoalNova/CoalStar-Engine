The resource thread, as managed by the engine, is responsible for handling not ony the acquisition and management of assets, but also of accessing hardware storage of disks and drives.

It starts by initializing itself, and verifies no initial memory allocation has failed. It may also perform heuristic greed calculations for resource collections, based on the game and hardware present.
