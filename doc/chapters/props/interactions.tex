Interactions with props are three fold, with static, input, and scripted interactions. Static interactions would be like those of sitting down in a chair. Input interactions may be like that of using a butter churn, needing input to operate. Scripted interactions would fulfill through a scripted interaction, like opening a door, unlocking a safe, or using an axe to fell a tree.
